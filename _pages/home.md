I am Manh-Duc Doan (or Doan Manh Duc), you can call me "Joan". I am currently Research Assistant at [Development and Policies Research Center](https://depocen.org/en/). I graduated BSc. in International Economics at Foreign Trade University, Hanoi, Vietnam. I also serve as research assistant. Currently, I am assisting [Prof. Do Quoc Anh](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/) (Monash University) in some research on political economy in Vietnam and the US.

My research interest focus on several applied microeconomics topics with micro-methods, especially in labor economics, political economics and development economics.
