Welcome!
========

Hi! I am Manh-Duc Doan, pronounced as "Joah". 

I am currently Research Assistant at [Development and Policies Research Center](https://depocen.org/en/). I graduated BSc. in International Economics at Foreign Trade University, Hanoi, Vietnam.

My research interest focus on several applied microeconomics topics with micro-methods, especially in labor economics, political economics and development economics.
